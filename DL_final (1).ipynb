    "## **1. Problem Recap and Dataset Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Group ID:** `GROUP123`\n",
    "* **Dataset and Modality:**\n",
    "  * The dataset used is **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) 2.0**. Its modality is **text**.\n",
    "  * It is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.\n",
    "  * To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning Task:**\n",
    "  * The task is **Extractive Question Answering (QA)**, a supervised learning problem.\n",
    "  * Given a context passage and a question, the model must predict the span of text within the context that answers the question.\n",
    "  * If the question is unanswerable based on the context, the model should indicate this.\n",
    "* **Target Variable(s) and Output Modeling:**\n",
    "  * The primary target variables are the **start and end token indices** of the answer span within the tokenized context.\n",
    "  * For answerable questions, the model predicts the index of the first token of the answer (`start_position`) and the index of the last token of the answer (`end_position`).\n",
    "  * For unanswerable questions, the target `start_position` and `end_position` are both set to index `0`. The model is trained to predict `(0, 0)` in these cases.\n",
    "  * The model output consists of two sets of logits, one for the start position and one for the end position, across all tokens in the input sequence. The predicted indices are obtained by taking the `argmax` of these logits.\n",
    "* **Why this dataset is meaningful, interesting, or challenging**\n",
    "  * **Meaningful:** SQuAD is a widely recognized benchmark for reading comprehension and Question Answering. Success on SQuAD often translates to better performance on real-world information retrieval and conversational AI tasks.\n",
    "  * **Interesting:** It directly tests a model's ability to understand context, locate relevant information, and perform reasoning based on textual evidence.\n",
    "  * **Challenging:**\n",
    "    * **Unanswerable Questions:** SQuAD v2 introduces the significant challenge of identifying when a question *cannot* be answered from the context, requiring the model not just to extract but also to abstain. This mirrors real-world scenarios where information might be missing.\n",
    "    * **Context Length:** Passages can be long, requiring models that can handle longer sequences.\n",
    "    * **Subtle Reasoning:** Some questions require nuanced understanding and reasoning beyond simple keyword matching."

    "### **2.1 Data Preparation Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet handles the essential task of taking the raw SQuAD v2 question-answering dataset and transforming it into a format that our deep learning model can understand and learn from. It is similar to translating human language and structure into the model's language of numbers and specific formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Load the Translator (Tokenizer):**\n",
    "* First, we load a special tool called a `tokenizer` (`AutoTokenizer`). This tokenizer is specifically designed for the `distilbert-base-cased` model we plan to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its main job is to break down sentences into smaller pieces (words or sub-words) called \"tokens\" and convert these tokens into unique numerical IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Clean Up the Text:**\n",
    "* Real-world text can be messy (e.g., extra spaces). The `clean_text` function tidies this up by removing extra whitespace from the beginning, end, and middle of the text passages (contexts) and questions.\n",
    "* The `apply_clean_text` function applies this cleaning consistently to all questions and contexts in the dataset using the efficient `.map()` method. It keeps track of the original IDs and answers associated with each example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Tokenize and Format for the Model:**\n",
    "* This is the most involved step, handled by `preprocess_squad_examples`. It takes the cleaned questions and contexts and prepares them for the model:\n",
    "  * **Combine & Tokenize:** It feeds pairs of questions and contexts to the tokenizer.\n",
    "  * **Handle Long Texts:** Context passages in SQuAD can be very long, often longer than the model can handle at once (`MAX_LENGTH`). The code deals with this using:\n",
    "    * `truncation=\"only_second\"`: If a combined question-context is too long, it only shortens (truncates) the context part.\n",
    "    * `stride`: To avoid losing information near the truncation point, it creates overlapping chunks. If a context is split, the next chunk starts `STRIDE` tokens before the previous one ended.\n",
    "    * `return_overflowing_tokens=True`: This tells the tokenizer to actually generate these multiple chunks (features) from a single long example.\n",
    "  * **Padding:** Ensures all processed sequences have the exact same length (`MAX_LENGTH`) by adding special \"padding\" tokens if they are too short.\n",
    "  * **Map Answers to Tokens:** This is crucial. The original dataset tells us the answer's start position in *characters*. The model, however, needs to predict the start and end *token* indices. This function calculates these target `start_positions` and `end_positions`.\n",
    "    * It uses `offset_mapping` (which tells us the start/end character position of each token) and `sequence_ids` (which tells us if a token belongs to the question or context) to find the correct token indices within the context part of the input.\n",
    "    * **Handling Unanswerable/Out-of-Span:** If a question is unanswerable in the original data, OR if the answer span doesn't fully fit within the current context chunk (due to truncation/stride), the target start and end positions are set to `0`. Index `0` usually corresponds to the special `[CLS]` token, signaling \"no answer found within this specific feature\".\n",
    "  * **Keep Metadata:** It carefully keeps track of which original example each feature came from (`example_id`), the character offsets for each token (`offset_mapping`), and the sequence IDs (`sequence_ids`). This information is vital later for evaluating the model's predictions correctly.\n",
    "* This complex function is applied efficiently to the entire cleaned dataset using `.map()`, removing the original text columns afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Organize and Format Data:**\n",
    "* The processed data is split back into `tokenized_train` and `tokenized_validation` sets containing the numerical features.\n",
    "* A separate copy of the original (but cleaned) `validation_examples` is kept, as it contains the original text needed for the final evaluation script.\n",
    "* The code then uses `set_format(\"torch\", ...)` to convert the necessary columns (like `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `start_positions`, `end_positions`, and the crucial metadata for validation) into PyTorch tensors, the numerical format required by the deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Optional Subsetting:**\n",
    "* There's an option (`use_subset = True/False`) to work with a smaller random sample of the data. This is useful for quick testing, debugging, or when computational resources are limited. If used, it ensures both the training/validation features *and* the original validation examples are filtered consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Prepare Data Loaders:**\n",
    "*   Finally, `DataLoader` objects are created for both training and validation sets. These are helper tools that efficiently group the processed data into batches (small groups of examples), shuffle the training data each epoch (to improve learning), and feed the data to the model during the training and evaluation phases. The validation loader often uses a larger batch size as it doesn't require gradient calculations.\n"

    "### **2.2 Post-Processing Overview: Turning Model Scores into Final Answers**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model finishes its job during evaluation, it doesn't directly output text answers. Instead, it gives us numerical scores (called \"logits\") indicating how likely each token in the input is to be the start or the end of a potential answer. This postprocess_qa_predictions function is like a translator and decision-maker that takes these raw scores and figures out the final, human-readable answer for each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this needed?**\n",
    "* The model outputs scores, not text.\n",
    "* Remember how long contexts were sometimes split into multiple overlapping chunks (features) during preprocessing? The model gives scores for *each chunk*. We need to combine the results from all chunks belonging to the same original question.\n",
    "* There might be many possible start/end token pairs. We need to find the combination that makes the most sense according to the model's scores.\n",
    "* A key part of SQuAD v2 is deciding if the question *can* be answered from the context. The model gives a score for a \"no answer\" option (tied to the special `[CLS]` token), and we need to compare this to the score of the best potential text answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works (Step-by-Step):**\n",
    "1. **Gather Information:**\n",
    "  * It takes the original `examples` (with context text and IDs), the processed `features` (with mappings from tokens back to text characters and sequence IDs), and the raw `start_logits` and `end_logits` from the model.\n",
    "  * It organizes the data so it can easily find all the processed features that came from the same original example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Each Original Example:** It goes through every single question-context pair from the original validation set one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check All Related Chunks (Features):** For a given example, it looks at *all* the processed chunks (features) that were created from it (if the context was long).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find Potential Answers within Each Chunk:**\n",
    "  * Inside each chunk, it looks at the start and end scores for every token.\n",
    "  * It identifies the top `n_best_size` (e.g., 20) most likely start tokens and top `n_best_size` most likely end tokens.\n",
    "  * It considers all possible pairs of these top start and end tokens.\n",
    "  * **Validity Checks:** It filters these pairs rigorously:\n",
    "    * Are both the start and end tokens actually *part of the context* (not the question or padding tokens)? (Uses `sequence_ids`).\n",
    "    * Are the start/end indices valid?\n",
    "    * Is the end token *after* the start token?\n",
    "    * Is the potential answer shorter than the allowed `max_answer_len`?\n",
    "    * Does the token pair actually map back to a non-empty piece of text in the original context? (Uses `offset_mapping`).\n",
    "    * **Score Candidates:** If a pair passes all checks, it calculates its score (start logit + end logit) and extracts the corresponding text snippet from the context. These valid text snippets and their scores are collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Track the \"No Answer\" Score:** For each chunk, it also calculates the score for picking the special `[CLS]` token (index 0) as both start and end. It keeps track of the *lowest* (most likely) \"no answer\" score found across all chunks for the current example.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Select the Overall Best Text Answer:** After checking all chunks for an example, it looks at all the valid text answers collected. It picks the one with the highest combined score as the `best_answer`. If no valid text answers were found, the `best_answer` is marked as empty with a score of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Make the Final Decision (Answer vs. No Answer):**\n",
    "  * It compares the score of the `best_answer` (the best text snippet found) with the `min_null_score` (the best score for predicting \"no answer\").\n",
    "  * **If the best text answer's score is higher:** It decides the question is answerable, and the final prediction is that text.\n",
    "  * **Otherwise (if the \"no answer\" score is higher or no valid text was found):** It decides the question is unanswerable, and the final prediction is an empty string `\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Format for Evaluation:** Finally, it gathers all the final text predictions (`\"\"` or the actual answer text) for every example ID and formats them into the specific structure required by the official SQuAD v2 evaluation script (including an ID, the prediction text, and a calculated \"no answer probability\" based on the CLS token scores).\n"

    "#### **2.3.2 Training and Evaluating the MLP**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **MLP Training Function (`train_one_epoch_mlp`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function handles the training process for a single epoch using the MLP model.\n",
    "For each batch of data:\n",
    "1. It moves the input token IDs and the target start/end positions to the active device (CPU or GPU).\n",
    "2. It ensures `input_ids` are LongTensors (required by the Embedding layer), not floats.\n",
    "3. It resets the gradients calculated in the previous step.\n",
    "4. It performs a forward pass through the MLP model, obtaining the predicted start and end logits.\n",
    "5. It calculates the loss using Cross-Entropy. The loss compares the predicted start logits\n",
    "with the true start positions, and the predicted end logits with the true end positions.\n",
    "The total loss is the sum of these two individual losses.\n",
    "6. It performs backpropagation to calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters.\n",
    "7. It updates the model's parameters using the chosen optimizer (e.g., AdamW) based on the calculated gradients.\n",
    "8. It accumulates the loss for the epoch and returns the average training loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **MLP Evaluation Function (`evaluate_mlp`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function evaluates the trained MLP model on the validation dataset using the\n",
    "official SQuAD v2 metrics (EM and F1). It runs after each training epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves:\n",
    "1. Setting the model to evaluation mode (disabling dropout, etc.).\n",
    "2. Iterating through the validation dataloader *without calculating gradients*.\n",
    "3. For each batch:\n",
    "  1. Move data to the device.\n",
    "  2. Perform a forward pass through the MLP to get start and end logits.\n",
    "  3. Calculate the validation loss for monitoring purposes.\n",
    "  4. **Collect Data for Post-Processing:** Store the predicted logits (start and end) and the necessary metadata (`offset_mapping`, `example_id`, `sequence_ids`) associated with each validation feature. This metadata is crucial for converting token-level predictions back into text.\n",
    "4. **After processing all batches:**\n",
    "  1. Concatenate the collected logits.\n",
    "  2. Call the `postprocess_qa_predictions` function (the same one used for DistilBERT). This function takes the raw logits and metadata, generates candidate text answers, compares them to the \"no answer\" score, and produces the final text predictions.\n",
    "  3. Prepare the ground truth reference answers in the required format.\n",
    "  4. Use the `evaluate` library's `squad_v2_metric` to compute the final EM and F1 scores by comparing the model's predictions against the references.\n",
    "5. Return the calculated average validation loss, EM score, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Main Training Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section sets up and runs the training and evaluation loop for the MLP model.\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameters:** Define key parameters like embedding dimension (`embed_dim`), number of hidden layers (`d`), neurons per hidden layer (`p`), number of epochs, and learning rate.\n",
    "2. **Model Instantiation:** Create an instance of the `QA_MLP` model using the defined hyperparameters and the vocabulary size from the tokenizer.\n",
    "3. **Optimizer & Loss:** Define the optimizer (AdamW is generally preferred over SGD for neural networks) and the loss function (CrossEntropyLoss).\n",
    "4. **Epoch Loop:** Iterate for the specified number of epochs:\n",
    "   1. Call `train_one_epoch_mlp` to train the model on the training data.\n",
    "   2. Call `evaluate_mlp` to evaluate the model on the validation data, obtaining validation loss, EM, and F1 scores.\n",
    "   3. Store these metrics in a `history` dictionary for later plotting.\n",
    "   4. Print the metrics for the current epoch.\n"

    "* The `Training Loss` decreases significantly in the first few epochs (8.25 -> 7.82 -> 7.44), suggesting the model *is* adjusting its weights based on the training data.\n",
    "* However, the `Validation Loss` starts low (~6.66) and then immediately begins to increase substantially (6.74 -> 7.07 -> 7.69 -> 8.50). This indicates **immediate and severe overfitting**. The model learns *something* from the training data, but it doesn't generalize *at all* to the unseen validation data; in fact, its performance on validation data gets worse quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insights on EM and F1 Scores:**\n",
    "* The `Validation EM` and `Validation F1` scores start at ~50.0 in Epoch 1 and stay almost exactly the same through Epoch 4.\n",
    "* Looking at the debug output and the sample predictions for Epoch 1-4, we see the `Final Predicted Text` is consistently `''` (empty string).\n",
    "* This pattern is identical to what we saw with the DistilBERT model *before* it was trained sufficiently. The ~50.0 score represents the percentage of **unanswerable questions** in the validation set. The MLP, by predicting `''` for everything, gets these correct by default.\n",
    "* **Crucially, the scores then *plummet* in Epoch 5** (EM ~43.5, F1 ~44.0). Why? Looking at the Epoch 5 sample predictions, the model starts outputting *some* text (e.g., 'ds' for the first example), but this text is clearly wrong. By predicting incorrect text instead of `''` for the unanswerable questions it was previously getting \"right\", its score drops significantly. It hasn't learned to predict the *correct* text for answerable questions *or* reliably predict `''` for unanswerable ones.\n"

    "The results perfectly illustrate *why* a simple MLP is unsuitable for this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The MLP processes the input as a flattened sequence of token embeddings. It has no built-in mechanism to understand:\n",
    "* The relationship between the question and the context.\n",
    "* The meaning of words based on surrounding words (e.g., \"bank\" meaning a river bank vs. a financial institution).\n",
    "* Long-range dependencies within the context passage.\n",
    "* The sequential order of words beyond what the initial embedding might capture positionally.It essentially sees a long, jumbled list of features and tries to find a pattern to predict start/end indices, which is incredibly difficult without understanding the *meaning* conveyed by the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inability to Locate Spans:** Finding a specific answer *span* requires identifying relevant parts of the context based on the question and then pinpointing the precise start and end boundaries. The MLP's simple feed-forward structure isn't designed for this kind of pointer-like localization task based on semantic understanding. It struggles to assign high scores to the *correct* start and end tokens simultaneously based on the input features alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overfitting:** While the MLP learns the training data (loss decreases), the validation loss immediately increases. This suggests the patterns it learns are superficial and specific to the training examples, failing completely to generalize because it hasn't captured the underlying language understanding required for the task.\n",

    "#### **2.3.5 Why is a Transformer (like DistilBERT/BERT) Needed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers excel where the MLP fails due to their core **Self-Attention mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contextual Embeddings:** Self-attention allows the model to look at all other words in the input (both question and context) when calculating the representation for a single word. This means the representation of a word is dynamically influenced by its context, capturing nuances in meaning.\n",
    "2. **Question-Context Interaction:** Attention mechanisms enable the model to explicitly learn the relationships between question tokens and context tokens, identifying which parts of the context are most relevant to the question being asked.\n",
    "3. **Sequence Modeling:** Transformers process the input sequentially (while allowing parallel computation) and inherently model the order and relationships between tokens over long distances.\n",
    "4. **Pre-training:** Models like BERT and DistilBERT are pre-trained on massive amounts of text data. They already possess a strong general understanding of language structure, grammar, and world knowledge, which they can then adapt (fine-tune) specifically for the QA task much more effectively than an MLP starting from scratch."

    "\n",
    "1. **Smaller Size:** DistilBERT has significantly fewer parameters than BERT-base (~66M vs. ~110M).\n",
    "2. **Faster Training & Inference:** This smaller size translates directly to faster training times per epoch and quicker predictions (inference). This is crucial for projects with limited computational resources (like typical academic assignments or deployments on edge devices).\n",
    "3. **Good Performance Trade-off:** DistilBERT retains a large percentage (often >95%) of BERT's performance on many tasks, including SQuAD, making it an excellent balance between speed/size and accuracy. For this project, achieving reasonable QA performance while keeping training times manageable was prioritized, making DistilBERT a suitable choice over the more resource-intensive BERT models."

Other architectures such as RNNs/ LSTMs perform worse than Transformers on such sequence tasks.\n",

This architecture is specifically tailored for extractive QA.\n",

DistilBERT's smaller size allows for larger batch sizes compared to BERT-base on the same hardware, potentially leading to faster training per epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimizer:** `AdamW`. This is the standard optimizer for training Transformers. It implements Adam with decoupled weight decay, which has been shown to be more effective than standard L2 regularization applied within the Adam algorithm. Reason for choosing `AdamW` compared to other optimizers:\n",
    "  *   *AdamW vs Adam:* AdamW generally provides better generalization by correctly applying weight decay.\n",
    "  *   *AdamW vs SGD/Momentum:* Adam-based optimizers typically converge much faster than SGD variants for complex models like Transformers, adapting the learning rate per parameter. While the previous experiments showed SGD/Momentum could work for the MLP, they are less common and often less efficient for fine-tuning large pre-trained models."

    "* **Dropout:** Applied within the DistilBERT layers (dropout probability typically 0.1), as defined in the pre-trained model configuration. This helps prevent co-adaptation of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weight Decay:** Applied via the `AdamW` optimizer (typical value `0.01`). This penalizes large weights, encouraging simpler models and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Layer Normalization:** Used within the Transformer blocks instead of Batch Normalization. It normalizes features across the hidden dimension for each sample independently, making it effective for variable-length sequences and generally preferred in Transformers. Batch Normalization is not typically used between Transformer layers."

    "* **Transfer Learning / Pretrained Models:** **Yes.** We're using a model named `distilbert-base-cased`. The reason for this is that it helps the model work better and faster because it has already learned a lot from seeing tons of text before. We got this model from Hugging Face transformers\n",
    "* **Attention Mechanisms:** **Yes.** Inside the DistilBERT model, there's self-attention. This is a key part of how Transformer models understand what words mean in relation to the other words around them. It's built right into how DistilBERT is made.\n",
    "* **Knowledge Distillation:** **Yes.** The DistilBERT model we're using was actually created using a special trick called knowledge distillation. Someone took a much bigger and smarter model (called BERT) and taught a smaller model (DistilBERT) to act like it. This smart teaching happened before we even started using DistilBERT, but we still get the good results from it."

    "* **Primary metrics** used for evaluating the model on the SQuAD v2 task are:\n",
    "  1. **Exact Match (EM):** This metric measures the percentage of predictions where the predicted answer text matches *exactly* with one of the ground-truth answer texts provided in the dataset. It is a strict, binary measure (1 for a perfect match, 0 otherwise).\n",
    "  2. **F1 Score:** This metric calculates the harmonic mean of precision and recall at the token level, considering the overlap between the predicted answer tokens and the ground-truth answer tokens. It gives partial credit for predictions that largely overlap with the ground truth, even if they aren't exact matches (e.g., minor differences in punctuation or boundaries). F1 is generally considered a more comprehensive measure for extractive QA than EM alone.\n",
    "  * EM and F1 are the standard and official metrics for the SQuAD benchmark. Using them ensures comparability with published results and provides a standard way to assess performance. EM measures strict accuracy, while F1 provides a more granular view of the prediction quality, accounting for partial correctness. The `evaluate` library's `squad_v2` metric implementation correctly handles the calculation for both, including the specific logic for unanswerable questions (where predicting an empty string `\"\"` when the ground truth is unanswerable counts as correct).\n",
    "* **Secondary Metric** used for monitoring training and stopping criteria:\n",
    "  * **Validation Loss (Cross-Entropy):** While not a final performance metric, the cross-entropy loss on the validation set was monitored during training. It reflects how well the model's predicted start/end logit distributions match the true distributions. It was used for the early stopping criterion because it's often a smoother and more direct indicator of model generalization compared to the non-differentiable EM/F1 scores.\n",

    "### **3.6 Potential Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the limitations observed for the model:\n",
    "* **Overfitting:** The model starts overfitting relatively early (after epoch 2). While early stopping prevents further degradation, the absolute peak performance might be limited by this tendency. The chosen hyperparameters (especially batch size 64) might contribute to this.\n",
    "* **DistilBERT Capacity:** The peak F1 score of ~68, while respectable for DistilBERT, is significantly lower than state-of-the-art models (often in the high 80s or low 90s F1). This reflects the inherent capacity limitation of the smaller distilled model. It may struggle with questions requiring very complex reasoning or understanding subtle nuances in long contexts.\n",
    "* **Misclassification of Answerability:** Qualitative example 3 shows the model still incorrectly identifies some answerable questions as unanswerable. This remains a key challenge on SQuAD v2. Conversely, it might also incorrectly provide answers for unanswerable questions (though not shown in this sample).\n",
    "* **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Performance is sensitive to hyperparameters (LR, batch size, weight decay, etc.), and while the current set yields reasonable results, further tuning (as discussed previously, e.g., smaller batch size) might yield marginal improvements."
