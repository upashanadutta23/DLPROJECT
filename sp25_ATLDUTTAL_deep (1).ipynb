    "***INTRODUCTION and DATASET OVERVIEW*** : The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v2, available on Hugging Face Datasets, is a benchmark for evaluating machine reading comprehension and question-answering models. It includes both answerable and unanswerable questions, challenging models to extract accurate answers or identify when no valid answer exists. The main goal of this project is to develop a robust question-answering model that can accurately extract answers from a given context while also identifying when a question is unanswerable. By leveraging the SQuAD v2 dataset, the project aims to fine-tune a transformer-based model, such as BERT or RoBERTa, to enhance its ability to understand context, reason effectively, and handle real-world QA scenarios where answers may or may not exist. This project ultimately seeks to build a reliable and intelligent QA system applicable to practical use cases.\n",
